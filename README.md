* [W3C Markup Validator - Results](assets/images/readme/w3cmarkupresults.pdf)
* [W3C CSS Validator - Results](assets/images/readme/w3ccssresults.pdf)

Following a 'fail' result due to the w3c checker returning no errors when checking my code i re-ran each page individually
using the 'by direct input' option and resolved the errors returned using this method.

All reports confirming no errors below:
